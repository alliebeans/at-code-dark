# @code:dark
### A dark gray theme with cyan accents for VS Code

This theme was created to match the theming from [@deb-xorg](https://github.com/alliebeans/at-deb-xorg.

Very much personalized token colors, tweaked from [Ayu](https://vscodethemes.com/e/teabyii.ayu/ayu-dark).
This theme was inspired by [Greyboard](https://github.com/micjohansson/greyboard).
